🔬 Research Experience
=====
* **Microwave Non-Invasive Blood Glucose Monitoring System** <span style="float: right;">2023.12 – 2024.06</span>  
  - **Hardware**: The microwave detection circuit uses the ESP32 as MCU, the voltage-controlled oscillator and the detector are used to generate and receive microwave signals respectively, and Fano resonance microwave sensor is used to measure the S-parameters.  
  - **Software**: The APP is developed on the Android Studio platform, the database is constructed based on SQLite, and the parameter configuration and glucose data transmission are realized through BLE.  
  - **Algorithm**: DBSCAN clustering algorism is adopted to identify and deal with abnormal glucose values deviating from the normal range, so as to effectively deal with the data anomalies brought about by complex factors such as equipment calibration, improper operation and changes in external environment.  

* **Deep Learning-based Meibomian Gland Image Analysis System** <span style="float: right;">2025.03 – 2025.08</span>  
  - **Preprocessing**: Integrated Gaussian denoising and Laplacian sharpening with alpha blending to enhance gland boundaries  
  - **Segmentation**: Developed eyelid and gland segmentation pipeline using U-Net variants (nnU-Net, U-Net++, Attention U-Net, ResUNet), achieving best IoU of 0.9022
  - **GUI**: Built Qt-based interface for image I/O, real-time segmentation, and Meiboscore visualization  

* **IoT-Based Thermostatic Biological Incubator** <span style="float: right;">2023.03 – 2023.06</span>  
  - **Hardware**: Developed an IoT-based thermostatic biological incubator using STM32 as the core controller, designed schematics and PCB layout using Altium Designer, and performed chip soldering.  
  - **Firmware**: Implemented temperature acquisition, setting, display, and PID control algorithms in C using Keil and established data communication with the server via NBIoT using TCP.  
  - **Software**: Developed an Android APP in Java, utilizing MQTT protocol to communicate with the server, allowing for convenient parameter display, configuration, and remote accessibility
