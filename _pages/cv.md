🔬 Research Experience
=====
* **Microwave Non-Invasive Blood Glucose Monitoring System** <span style="float: right;">2023.12 – 2024.06</span>  
  - **Hardware**: The microwave detection circuit uses the ESP32 as MCU, the voltage-controlled oscillator and the detector are used to generate and receive microwave signals respectively, and Fano resonance microwave sensor is used to measure the S-parameters.  
  - **Software**: The APP is developed on the Android Studio platform, the database is constructed based on SQLite, and the parameter configuration and glucose data transmission are realized through BLE.  
  - **Algorithm**: Established the correlation between S-parameters and glucose concentration through experimental design and cubic polynomial fitting; applied DBSCAN clustering to detect and correct abnormal glucose values caused by calibration or environmental disturbances.

* **Deep Learning-based Meibomian Gland Image Analysis System** <span style="float: right;">2025.03 – 2025.08</span>  
  - **Preprocessing**: Combined Gaussian denoising and Laplacian sharpening with adaptive alpha blending to enhance gland contrast and boundary clarity
  - **Image Segmentation**: Designed a two-stage segmentation pipeline for eyelids and glands using multiple U-Net variants (nnU-Net, U-Net++, Attention U-Net, ResUNet), achieving a best IoU of 0.9022 on test data
  - **Feature Engineering & Classification**: Extracted morphological and texture-based features from segmented glands, and applied a Random Forest classifier to predict gland atrophy levels with high interpretability
  - **GUI**: Implemented a PyQt-based interface supporting image import/export, real-time segmentation visualization, and automated Meiboscore grading  

* **IoT-Based Thermostatic Biological Incubator** <span style="float: right;">2023.03 – 2023.06</span>  
  - **Hardware**: Developed an IoT-based thermostatic biological incubator using STM32 as the core controller, designed schematics and PCB layout using Altium Designer, and performed chip soldering.  
  - **Firmware**: Implemented temperature acquisition, setting, display, and PID control algorithms in C using Keil and established data communication with the server via NBIoT using TCP.  
  - **Software**: Developed an Android APP in Java, utilizing MQTT protocol to communicate with the server, allowing for convenient parameter display, configuration, and remote accessibility
